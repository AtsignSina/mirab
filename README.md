# Mirab
Mirab is an event publisher service.
It's mostly designed for dynamic scheduled business logic.
## Name
**Mirab** was a person who was responsible for working with the water clock and determining the water share between the farmers.
Mirabi is the profession name which is obsolete already.

I named this service after all the mirabs who tries all their life for a precise time-sharing.
